# ANLY 511 Prob Modeling/Stat Computing

Probabilistic models are essential for the understanding of data that are affected by uncertainty. This course introduces students to the fundamentals of probabilistic modeling and then covers computational techniques for the analysis of data. Students will learn to construct probabilistic models for simulation and analysis and use them to extract information from given data sets. The course will use statistical software (R) throughout.
